               This week the team has had a meeting about the future of the game and we have divided the rest of the work among us.

               This week the team has been working on reviewing the results of the play testing day and getting ready to put the finishing touches on the video game.

               This week the team has been working on the following:
			   <br>Josh: Updated menu art, added a prototype room based alarm system, added audio for the game, going to be adding a change to the look of the lighting on enemies.
       <br>Phillip: Attempting to make sprites for the hero and enemies
       <br>Jorge: Fleshed out the combat system to have both melee and have the enemy attack the player. I also added the start to a projectile based combat system.

               This week the group has mostly been trying to get things ready for the presentation on Monday and trying to plan feedback
       <br>Josh: Worked with Phillip helping to get the AI in order.
       <br>Phillip: Worked on incorporating Vision cones and Joshâ€™s pathfinding into the basic AI state machine, that allows the AI to patrol, chase, search, and return home.
       <br>Jorge: Started to get a combat system in place. So far have the player attacking the enemy.

                The team has been working on the following:
       <br>Josh: Polished the pathfinding system more and worked on the demo level.
       <br>Phillip: Finished adding the depth mask shader to use for the blindzone material (The part of the player vision that hides enemies) and fixed a bug causing issues with rendering the vision system. Worked on integrating the vision cones into Josh's waypoint pathfinding system.
       <br>Jorge: Worked on getting a level ready for the demo and getting the pieces implemented into the level. Also looked for art assets of the item pickup mechanic.

				The team has been working on the following:
				<br>Phillip has been working on: Worked on adding features to the vision cone, adding a second optional mesh it can generate (for the cone itself along with the blind zone). Adding a material to block out view of enemies and key items when they're in the blindzone. 
				<br>Joshua has been working on: Scrapping the previous A* solution and implemented a BFS to construct a path of waypoints that the AI can follow. Can naviagte to the closet waypoint near the player with way better performance. Have an aggressive follow in prototype. Need to now cause AI to zoom at player on-site.
				<br>Jorge has been working on: This week I have been doing some final tweaks to the mouse following scripts and finally have gotten it to work in a way I am happy with. I also added a feature to the item pickup where a player will drop the item they are currently holding.

				The team has been working on the following:
				<br>Phillip has been working on: Upgrading the vision script to add create and build the mesh for the blindzone portion of the cone as well as create a build a polygon collider. Working on setting up the meshes for the vision portion itself and having it hide enemies and key items.
				<br>Joshua has been working on: more on the A* script, although there is difficulty with thrashing and selecting the correct hueristic. Talked with Ron from FIEA and Tom Carbone and may take their suggestion for a way faster waypoint system that implements A*.
				<br>Jorge has been working on: This past week I focused on fixing a few bugs with the item pickup system. The system seems to be working fine. I developed it in a way that it is easy to add more to it later. I also started work on a turning system so that the character can move the player. Still buggy need to see better solutions to that

				The team has been working on the following:
				<br>Phillip has been working on: Setting up the script that dynamically builds the mesh for the vision cones by casting several rays and using the ray-hits as vertices. also working on setting it up with a player prefab and attaching a meshcollider to it.
				<br>Joshua has been working on: an A* Pathfinding algorithm to have enemies intelligibly navigate through the corridors in the game towards the player or set destination points.
				<br>Jorge has been working on: This past week I got a scene up and running with a moveable character and making sure the camera worked as needed. Also found some assets just for starting the game. We may change them if we find anything better. Also worked on picking up items and equipping them to the character.

                Last week and the current week both consisted of the game proposal presentations. We finalized all of our ideas and ironed out as many "maybes" as we could during a team meeting just before submitting our slides, then presented our project on Wednesday 9/19. We think the presentation went well (there wasn't much time for feedback after ours, but the professor and other students seemed content) and are excited to begin development. We've also set up a Unity Collab project for us all to begin working on the project.

                This week the team has been working on the first presentation. We started work on the slideshow on Monday. On Friday we had a team meeting where we discussed what each
				person will bring to the team. We have also set up the structure where we will meet every week to have discussions on the team status and the future direction. For the 
				rest of the week each person worked on the slides. On Sunday each team member looked over the slides and ensure we can each present for around 3 minutes so that we can
				complete the 10 minute mark for the presentation.

                This is the start of our development blog for our game. The developers are Phillip Da Silva, Joshua Sylvestre, and Jorge Vidal. In our first week together, we threw around a bunch of ideas of what game we wanted to make, what game engine to use for it, and many other details. We've landed on using Unity to create a space samurai themed stealth game. Now we've laid out a general plan and will pitch it to the rest of our class.
